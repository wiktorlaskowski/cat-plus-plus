Install a userscript manager such as TamperMonkey or ViolentMonkey, then simply click on the links above and confirm the installation. Scripts should be automatically updated by default.

Scratch does not currently disallow userscripts or other similar modifications; they just disallow the sharing of them on the Scratch website.
